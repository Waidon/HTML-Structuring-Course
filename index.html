            <h1>My Journey as a Web Developer</h1>
            <p>
                My journey into web development began with a simple desire: <em>to build
                    something meaningful and shareable from scratch.</em>
            </p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <article>
                <p>
                    My journey into web development started with a curiosity about how
                    websites were built and the impact they could have on people and
                    businesses.&nbsp; At first, it felt overwhelming, there were so many
                    languages, tools, and frameworks to explore. &nbsp;But as I took my first
                    steps learning HTML and CSS, I realized that building websites was not
                    just about writing code, but about creating meaningful experiences for
                    users. &nbsp;This sparked a passion that continues to drive me today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, I began focusing on the foundations, making sure I
                    understood not only how to structure pages, but how to do it the right
                    way. I embraced <strong>semantic HTML</strong> to build clean, accessible, and
                    professional websites.&nbsp; From there, I expanded my knowledge into CSS
                    for design and layout, JavaScript for interactivity, and even learning
                    CSS frameworks for creating more dynamic applications.&nbsp; Each project I
                    built, whether a simple landing page, a personal portfolio, or a
                    website for a business, it became a stepping stone to deepen my skills
                    and apply what I was learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alongside the technical skills, I’ve grown to appreciate the
                    importance of design, user experience, and accessibility.&nbsp; For me, web
                    development is more than just code, it’s about solving problems,
                    making information accessible, and giving individuals or businesses a
                    digital presence they can be proud of. &nbsp;My long-term goal is to keep
                    growing as a front-end developer, while using what I learn to help
                    others, whether through affordable web solutions, educational
                    resources, or projects that bring communities together.
